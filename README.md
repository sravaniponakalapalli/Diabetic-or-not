# Diabetic or Not Machine learning Project
## Overview
This project is designed to predict whether a patient has diabetes or not based on various health indicators. It utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze a dataset containing information about patients' medical histories and makes predictions.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found on kaggle: [Diabetic prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kandij/diabetes-dataset/data).It includes information about demographic and health-related attributes, as well as a binary outcome variable indicating whether the individual has been diagnosed with diabetes.
## Dependencies
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running notebooks)
## Models
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is a powerful supervised machine learning model commonly used for classification tasks. In this project, we employed the SVM classifier to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on various health indicators such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, etc.
## Results
The "Diabetic or Not" project aimed to predict whether an individual has diabetes based on various health parameters using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. After training and evaluating the model, we obtained promising results in terms of predictive performance.
